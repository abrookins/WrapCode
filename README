This plugin makes a "Wrap Code" command available in Sublime Text 2 that wraps
selected text to a certain width (column).

The width is configurable as a user setting and defaults to 80. Unlike the
built-in "Wrap" command, "Wrap Code" is intelligent. If a wrapped line was
commented-out, new lines will begin with the same comment character. They will
also indent to the same level as the original line.
