This plugin makes a "Wrap Code" command available in Sublime Text 2 that wraps
selected text to a certain width.

The width is configurable as a user setting and defaults to 80 characters.
Unlike the built-in "Wrap" command, "Wrap Code" is intelligent. If a wrapped
line was commented-out, new lines will begin with the same comment character.
They will also indent to the same level as the original line.

Wrap Code includes a Vintage mode key binding by default -- the same as the
"reformat" operation in Vim. In command mode, highlight the text you want to
wrap, then press the "gq" keys.
